# NexArch: A Brutal 6-Month Journey from Learner to Builder

This repository documents a 6-month, self-driven journey to master the fundamentals of software engineering. It's not a course, a bootcamp, or a tutorial. It's a daily confrontation with the difficult, uncomfortable, and ultimately rewarding process of becoming a real-world problem solver.

The content is structured as a series of daily blog posts, each tackling core concepts in Python and Java, complete with practical coding problems and interview insights.

*"A book must be the axe for the frozen sea inside us."* — Franz Kafka

## The Curriculum: A Daily Grind

The curriculum is delivered through a series of daily blog posts. Each day builds on the last, moving from fundamental syntax to complex architectural patterns.

### Week 1: The Foundation

*   **[Day 1: Mastering Programming Fundamentals](./blogs/week1-day1.html)**
    *   **Topics:** Core syntax, variables, I/O, control flow.
    *   **Languages:** Python & Java.
    *   **Core Idea:** Learning the basic vocabulary of code.

*   **[Day 2: From Commands to Creations](./blogs/week1-day2.html)**
    *   **Topics:** Functions, methods, and foundational data structures (Lists, Arrays, Dictionaries, HashMaps).
    *   **Languages:** Python & Java.
    *   **Core Idea:** Building reusable tools and organizing data.

*   **[Day 3: The Leap to Algorithmic Thinking](./blogs/week1-day3.html)**
    *   **Topics:** Introduction to algorithms, sorting (Bubble Sort), searching (Linear & Binary Search), and Big O notation.
    *   **Languages:** Python & Java.
    *   **Core Idea:** Moving from writing code to analyzing it.

## How to Use This Repository

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/NexArch.git
    ```
2.  **Open `index.html`:** This file serves as the main portal to all the blog posts. Open it in your web browser to get started.
3.  **Follow the Days:** Start with Day 1. Read the concepts, but more importantly, **do the problems**. Struggle with them before looking at the solutions. The explanations are designed to be read *after* you've tried.
4.  **No Shortcuts:** The goal is not to finish, but to understand. If you can't explain a concept in your own words, you haven't learned it yet.

## The Philosophy: Explain or Die

*"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."* — Richard Feynman

Programming isn't about memorizing syntax. It's about clarity of thought. The entire approach of this repository is built on the Feynman Technique:

1.  **Learn it:** Absorb the technical knowledge from the post.
2.  **Teach it:** Explain the concept and the code (to a rubber duck, a notebook, or a friend).
3.  **Identify Gaps:** Notice where your explanation is weak or confusing. That's where you need to study more.
4.  **Simplify:** Refine your understanding until you can explain it in the simplest possible terms.

## The Uncomfortable Rules

1.  **No Excuses:** Your background doesn't matter. Your effort does.
2.  **No Comfort Zone:** If it feels easy, you're not learning.
3.  **No Participation Trophies:** The only thing that matters is working, well-understood code.

This is your journey. The code doesn't care about your fears. It only cares if you can think.

**Start with Day 1. The only way out is through.**
